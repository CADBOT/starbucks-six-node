# Lab Instructions
Pass the name of the files to the lab program via the command line "node lab.js file1.txt file2.txt"
. Have it read and print out the contents of those files as fast as possible. The exact order of these printouts can be nondeterministic
Write another program that does the same thing, but this time it should print out the files in order.

Given the short lengths of the included text files, both versions of the code might appear to be deterministic
